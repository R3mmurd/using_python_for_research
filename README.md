# [Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research)

This repository contains my solutions for programming assigments of this course.
You should not use these codes for your own solutions in case you are doing the
course. But you could study them for learning purposes.

## Course description

This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python.
In this course, after reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn about tools commonly used in research settings.
Using a combination of a guided introduction and more independent in-depth exploration, we solve various case studies
chosen for their scientific breadth and their coverage of different Python features.

It was assigned a homework for each week. Each of them are solved in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
The description for each homework is the following:

- **[Homework 1](HW1.ipynb)** (file [HW1.ipynb](HW1.ipynb)):  Using objects, functions, and randomness
  to find the length of documents, approximate pi, and smooth out random noise.

- **[Homework 2](HW2.ipynb)** (file [HW2.ipynb](HW2.ipynb)):  Tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) is a simple strategy
  game in which two players take turns placing a mark on a 3x3 board, attempting to make a row, column, or diagonal of
  three with their mark. In this homework, we use the tools we've covered in the past two weeks to create a tic-tac-toe
  simulator and evaluate basic winning strategies.

- **[Case Study 1 - Caesar Cipher](HW3-1.ipynb)** (file [HW3-1.ipynb](HW3-1.ipynb)): A cipher is a secret code for a language.
  In this case study, we explore a cipher that is reported by contemporary Greek historians to have been used by
  Julius Caesar to send secret messages to generals during times of war.

- **[Case Study 2 - Translations of Hamlet](HW3-2.ipynb)** (file [HW3-2.ipynb](HW3-2.ipynb)): In this case study, we find and
  plot the distribution of word frequencies for each translation of Hamlet.

- **[Case Study 3 - Practice with Classification](HW3-3.ipynb)** (file [HW3-3.ipynb](HW3-3.ipynb)): In this case study,
  we analyze a dataset consisting of an assortment of wines classified into "high quality" and "low quality",
  and use k-Nearest Neighbors to predict whether or not other information about the wine helps us correctly guess
  whether a new wine will be of high quality.

- **[Case Study 4 - Visualizing Whisky Classification](HW4-1.ipynb)** (file [HW4-1.ipynb](HW4-1.ipynb)): In this case study,
  we prepare plots in Bokeh, a library designed for simple and interactive plotting. We demonstrate Bokeh by continuing
  the analysis of Scotch whiskies.

- **[Case Study 5 - Bird Migration](HW4-2.ipynb)** (file [HW4-2.ipynb](HW4-2.ipynb)): In this case study,
  we continue taking a look at patterns of flight for each of the three birds in our dataset.

- **[Case Study 6 - Social Network Analysis](HW4-3.ipynb)** (file [HW4-3.ipynb](HW4-3.ipynb)): Homophily is a
  network characteristic. Homophily occurs when nodes that share an edge share a characteristic more often than
  nodes that do not share an edge. In this case study, we investigate homophily of several characteristics of
  individuals connected in social networks in rural India.

- **[Case Study 7 - Movie Analysis, Part 1 - Data Preparation](HW5-1.ipynb)** (file [HW5-1.ipynb](HW5-1.ipynb)): The
  [movie dataset on which this case study is based](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) is a database of 5000
  movies catalogued by [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en). The information available
  about each movie is its budget, revenue, rating, actors and actresses, etc. In this case study, we use this dataset to
  determine whether any information about a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. We also attempt to predict whether
  a movie's revenue will exceed its budget. In Part 1, we inspect, clean, and transform the data.

- **[Case Study 7 - Movie Analysis, Part 2 - Modeling](HW5-2.ipynb)** (file [HW5-2.ipynb](HW5-2.ipynb)): In Part 2,
  we use the dataset prepared in Part 1 for an applied analysis.
